## Our Inspiration and Journey 🌟

### Inspiration 💡

As students at ALX, we were often overwhelmed by the number of assignments, group projects, and personal tasks we had to manage. We realized that having a reliable tool to organize our tasks would significantly improve our productivity and reduce stress.

## Usage

1. **Register and Login:** Create an account or log in with an existing account.
2. **Create Tasks:** Navigate to the dashboard and create new tasks.
3. **Assign Collaborators:** Assign tasks to other users.
4. **Add Notes:** Add notes to tasks for additional context.
5. **Real-Time Updates:** Receive real-time updates on task progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Web framework for Python.
- **SQLAlchemy:** ORM for database management.
- **Jinja2:** Templating engine for rendering HTML.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript:** For front-end interactivity.

## Architecture

To-Do follows a client-server architecture with RESTful APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end. The front-end is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly.

## Learnings

Throughout the development of To-Do, our team enhanced their skills in Flask, SQLAlchemy, and RESTful API design. The project also improved our understanding of real-time web applications and secure authentication methods.
